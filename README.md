## About

This project was made during the *Maratona Explorer*, which was a **Rocketseat** ðŸš€ event about programming basics taught by **Mayk Brito**.

The goal was to create a web page where you ask a question, and got a **mysterious divination** as an answer.

## Increments

All the code follows the basic structure taught in the classes, however, I decided to translate all *content/classes* into **English**.

## Preview

I hope you have fun with the answers!
